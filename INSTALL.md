# Install Open Source Event Manager
All the information that you need to install OSEM. If you have any problems with installing don't hesitate to [contact us](https://github.com/openSUSE/osem#contact)

## Versions
OSEM is an [semantic versioned](http://semver.org/) app. That means given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH we increment the:

1. MAJOR version when we make incompatible changes,
2. MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
3. PATCH version when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Download
You can find the latest OSEM releases on our [release page](https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/releases/latest) ([older release here](https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/releases))

## Deploy
OSEM is a *Ruby on Rails* application. We recommend to run OSEM in production with [mod_passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/download/#open_source)
and the [apache web-server](https://www.apache.org/). There are tons of guides on how to deploy rails apps on various
base operating systems. [Check Google](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ruby%20on%20rails%20apache%20passenger) ;-)

For more information about rails and what it can do, see the [rails guides.](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

<p>
  We are pleased to announce the first stable release of the Open Source Event
  Manager (OSEM), a event management application tailored to free software
  conferences. OSEM helps your community with the paper submission/selection
  process, registration of attendees and the marketing of your event.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>1.0</em> release contains more than 1.800 inidividual contributions from over
  30 free software hackers. It has powered the last four
  <a href="https://events.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a> and three
  <a href=" https://conference.owncloud.org/">ownCloud</a> conferences with over
  1.000 attendees and 500 paper submissions. It is a proven, stable and
  enjoyable project that we think is more than ready for general consumption.
</p>

  Read on for hightlights of OSEM 1.0!

<h2>Communicate the value of your event</h2>
  <p>
    Confernces are about bringing the people of your community closer together.
    Gathering in one place strengthens the relationships, makes communication
    easier and will create lasting shared memories. But to get people to take up
    travel and come to your event you need to convince them that it's worth it.
    OSEM helps you do that by taking all the data of your event (time, place,
    program etc.) to build a web site for your conference with all the information
    the attendees need. Communicate the value of your event and convince people to
    register &amp; buy tickets.

<h2>Inspire your community with content</h2>
<p>
  Your event will only be as good as the content your community presents. It's
  the knowledge, inspiration and joy from the talks, workshops and social events
  that people will take home with them. It's the content that will spark new
  ideas and leap your project forward. To get the best program together OSEM
  makes it super easy for your speakers to submit proposals and equally smooth
  for your organizers to classify, evaluate and schedule submissions.

<h2>Know your conference</h2>
<blockquote>
  Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. - Kofi Annan
</blockquote>
<p>
  It's important for you as an event organizer to know about the evolution of
  your event. Do you have enough content to fill your schedule? How many people have registered? Do you have the <em>right</em>
  content for your audience? Which of your blog posts, tweets, banners drove the
  most people to your event? OSEM will help you answer these questions with a
  data driven dashboard. Get an 30.000 feet overview or dive into all the nitty
  gritty details at any point in time.

        Instructions to add your own domain
      %hr
      %p
        When you created the conference, the conference splash page is available in the following domain:
        %strong
          osem.io/conferences/#{@conference.short_title}
      %p
        However, we also provide support for hosting conferences on your own domain.

        Terms to get familiar with:
      %p
        %strong
          Domain registrar:
        Domain registrar is just another term used for providers who work on reserving domain names.
      %p
        %strong
          CNAME:
        A Canonical Name record is a resource used which defines that your domain name is an alias for another domain name.
      %p
        To add your own domain you can follow these 
        %i
          three
        steps:
      %ol
        %li
          Pick a domain you want to host your conference on from a domain registrar or register it with a domain registrar.
        %li
          Add your own domain name to OSEM ( link to conference/custom_domain#create ) and select the conference it should belong to.
        %li
          The last step is adding a CNAME record in your registrar’s DNS Settings. Different registrars have different ways of adding a CNAME record. The following guides would help you setup a CNAME record depending upon the registrar of your domain. If it doesn’t, you probably should get in touch with your domain registrar and ask him how to register a CNAME record in their platform.

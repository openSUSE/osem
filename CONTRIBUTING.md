# Contributing to OSEM
Our open source project is open to contributions. Open your [issue](https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/issues/new) and send a PR!

We welcome new developers, and we actively participate in mentoring programs, such as [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [RGSoC](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/).

## Request for contributions
We are always looking for contributions to OSEM. Read this guide on how to do that.

In particular, this community seeks the following types of contributions:

* code: contribute your expertise in an area by helping us expand OSEM
* ideas: participate in an issues thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
* code editing: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content of OSEM

## Running OSEM in development
We are using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to create our development environments.

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox 5.0.10](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_0). Both tools support Linux, MacOS and Windows.

2. Install [vagrant-exec](https://github.com/p0deje/vagrant-exec):

    ```
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-exec
    ```

3. Clone this code repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/openSUSE/osem.git
    ```

4. Execute Vagrant in the cloned directory:

    ```
    vagrant up
    ```

5. Start your OSEM rails app:

    ```
    vagrant exec /vagrant/bin/rails server -b 0.0.0.0
    ```

6. Check out your OSEM rails app:
You can access the app [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Whatever you change in your cloned repository will have effect in the development environment. Sign up, the first user will be automatically assigned the admin role.

7. Changed something? Test your changes!:

    ```
    vagrant exec bundle exec rspec spec
    ```

8. Explore the development environment:

    ```
    vagrant ssh
    ```

9. Or issue any standard `rails`/`rake`/`bundler` command by prepending `vagrant exec`

    ```
    vagrant exec bundle exec rake db:migrate
    ```

## How to contribute code
* Prerequisite: familiarity with [GitHub Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and issues.
* Fork the repository and make a pull-request with your changes
  * Make sure that the test suite passes before you request a pull and that you comply to our ruby styleguide.
  * Please increase code coverage by your pull request (coveralls or simplecov locally will give you insight)
* One of the OSEM maintainers will review your pull-request
  * If you are already a contributor and you get a positive review, you can merge your pull-request yourself
  * If you are not already a contributor please request a merge via the pull-request comments

### Coding Style
We are using [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) as a style checker. It is checking code style each time the test suite runs. You can run it locally with

```shell
vagrant exec bundle exec rubocop
```

You can read through current enabled rules in `.rubocop.yml` file. Explanations of the defined [rules](http://rubydoc.info/github/bbatsov/rubocop/master/frames) can be found in modules [Cop::Lint](http://rubydoc.info/github/bbatsov/rubocop/master/Rubocop/Cop/Lint) and [Cop::Style](http://rubydoc.info/github/bbatsov/rubocop/master/Rubocop/Cop/Style) and [Cop:Rails](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cops_rails/).
Additionally you can read through the [ruby style-guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) to better understand core principles.

### Test Suite
We are using [rspec](http://rspec.info/)+[capybara](http://teamcapybara.github.io/capybara/)+[factory girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl) as a test suite. You can run it locally

```shell
vagrant exec bundle exec rspec
```

### Email Notifications
**Note**: We use [letter_opener](https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener) in development environment. You can check out your mails by visiting [localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener).

### Using iChain in test mode
[devise_ichain_authenticatable](https://github.com/openSUSE/devise_ichain_authenticatable) comes with
test mode, which can be useful in development phase in which an iChain proxy is
not usually configured or even available. You can enable ichain authentication by setting `OSEM_ICHAIN_ENABLED` equal to `true` in `.env` file. You would also need to set following options in `devise.rb`:

```Ruby
# Activate the test mode
config.ichain_test_mode = true

# 'testuser' user will be permanently signed in.
config.ichain_force_test_username = "testuser"

# set email of 'testuser'
config.ichain_force_test_attributes = {:email => "testuser@example.com"}
```

### Using OpenID in developement
OSEM supports [OpenID](https://openid.net/) logins via [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) and related provider specific gems. OmniAuth provides the ablity to define per-provider mock accounts for testing. The supported providers are Facebook, Google, openSUSE and GitHub. If you want to use the OSEM provided mock accounts you need to set the appropriate `OSEM_PROVIDER_KEY` and `OSEM_PROVIDER_SECRET` environment variables to a non empty string in the `.env` file.

e.g.
```
OSEM_GITHUB_KEY='sample'
OSEM_GITHUB_SECRET='sample'
```

If you don't already have a `.env` file you can use the `dotenv.example` as a template.

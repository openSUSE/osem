# Request for contributions
We are always looking for contributions to OSEM. Read this guide on how to do that. 

In particular, this community seeks the following types of contributions:

* code: contribute your expertise in an area by helping us expand OSEM
* ideas: participate in an issues thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
* copy editing: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content of OSEM

# How to contribute
* Prerequisites: familiarity with [GitHub Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and issues.
* Fork the repository and make a pull-request with your changes
  * Make sure that the test suite passes (we have [travis](https://travis-ci.org/openSUSE/osem) enabled) before you request a pull and that you comply to our ruby styleguide (we make use of [hound-ci](https://houndci.com/)).
  * Please make sure to mind what travis and hound tell you! :-)
* One of the OSEM maintainers will review your pull-request 
  * If you are already a contributor (means you're in the [group osem-committers](https://github.com/orgs/openSUSE/teams/osem-committers)) and you get a positive review, you can merge your pull-request yourself
  * If you are not a contributor already please request a merge via the pull-request comments
* Run rubocop locally for fixes according to HoundCI comments
